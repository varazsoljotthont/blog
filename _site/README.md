# LittlevGL's blog

## Writing a blog post about your experiences

Have you ported LittlevGL to a new platform? Have you created a fancy GUI? Do you know a great trick? 
You can share your knowledge on LittlevGL's blog! It's super easy to add your own post:
- Fork and clone the [blog repository](https://github.com/littlevgl/blog)
- Add your post in Markdown to the `_posts` folder. 
- Store the images and other resources in a dedicated folder in `assets`
- Create a Pull Request

The blog uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to convert the `.md` files to a webpage. You can easily [run Jekyll offline](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to check your post before creating the Pull request
