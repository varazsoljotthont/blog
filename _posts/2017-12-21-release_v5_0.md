Here is the v5.0.0 release with a much simpler architecture. Now the graphics library means only the lvgl repository. Besides the architectural changes Unicode support, style themes, new smart phone-like object types are added. To make easier to get started a tutorial is released  in lv_examples repository

**Note that it's major release so it's not backward compatible.**

To learn the new features its highly recommended to read the basics in the [Documentation](https://littlevgl.com/porting)

## Architectural changes
- Integrate misc into lvlg
- Integrate hal** into lvlg
- Convert Applications into simple examples
- Rename repository from proj_pc to pc_simulator
- Create a new independent repository for examples (lv_examples)
- Create a new independent repository for development boards (lv_boards)
- Create a new independent repository for drivers (lv_drivers)

## System level changes
- Object type inheritance is hidden. Every object have its own API (except `lv_obj_set/get_...` functions)
- Rework lv_style_t to be more versatile
- Rename (and slightly rework) some function, defines and enums to be more descriptive
- Make styles to global variable for less typing
- Make fonts to global variables for less typing and easy user-font adding
- Join symbol fonts into normal built-in fonts (use normal fonts, and lvlg will find symbol fonts too)
- rename lv_dispi_... to lv_indev_...
- Simplified action functions: `lv_res_t action (lv_obj_t * obj)` use `lv_indev_act()`if required

## New features
- Unicode support with UTF-8 decode
- Themes with predefined styles
- lv_tabview: new object type to organize content with tabs
- lv_sw: new object type, switch, turn on/off by tap (a little slider)
- lv_roller: new object type, a roller to select a value (like on smartphones)
- lv_kb: new object type, Keyboard
- lv_btnm: lv_btnm_set_toggle() to toggle last button
- lv_btnm: rework width control. Now a control byte is used for width, hide and no long press settings.
- lv_ta: cursor types
-  lv_gauge_ rework to make it more like line meter (remove background but add scale lines)
- partial border draw in styles
- Hide anti-aliasing upscale (no x * LV_DOWSCALE is required)

## Bugfixes
Due to [lv_tests](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_examples/tree/master/lv_tests) massive number of bug fixes happened.
