![Image button, calendar arc and preloader in LittelvGL embedded GUI v5.2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7599318/45851820-0fc4a380-bd3d-11e8-8dab-c7d98b12879e.png)

## Draw and rendering
- **Line draw** algorithm is improved to support perpendicular line endings
- **Arc drawing**
- **Shadow drawing** improvements
- **Custom VDB write** function can be registered in the display driver to support non-standard color formats. This the VDB content can be directly flushed to the display. 
- **RGB565 swap** to swap the two bytes of RGB565 colors. It makes possible to simply send the pixel's data via a 8-bit serial interface (e.g. SPI). It can be enabled in *lv_conf.h* by setting `LV_COLOR_16_SWAP`.
- **VDB address** can be set in runtime with `lv_vdb_set_adr()`. Useful if you want to use DMA in the `disp_flush` function but the VDB need to be allocated in a specific way.
- **New image formats** supporting **Indexed** and **Grayscale** formats too to save memory
- **Image decoder interface** to add support to any image format like PNG
- **Dithering** support in Online image converter

## New object features
- **lv_obj** opa scale attribute added to scale the current opacity of an object and its children (useful to fade in/out a group of objects) 
- **lv_label** LV_LABEL_ALIGN_RIGHT added to enable right alignmenet of texts.
- **lv_label** LV_LABEL_LONG_CROP long mode to simply crop the text out of the label's size. 
- **lv_btn** Ink effect feature added to play an animation effect when a button is clicked and released. Can be enabled with `lv_btn_set_ink_in_time()`, `lv_btn_set_ink_wait_time()`, `lv_btn_set_ink_out_time()` and LV_BTN_INK_EFFECT` need to be enabled in *lv_conf.h*.
- **lv_page, lv_win, lv_ta** scrolling is added on `LV_GROUP_KEY_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT`
- **lv_page** temporal scrollbar hide option is added (`LV_SB_MODE_HIDE`)
- **lv_ta** `max_length` and `accepted_chars` attributes are added.d to be enabled in *lv_conf.h*.
- **lv_ta** action can be added with `lv_ta_set_action()`

- LV_FONT_CUSTOM define added in lv_conf.h where you can enumerate you custom fonts to make them global
- LV_CONF_INCLUDE_SIMPLE: define it as a compiler symbol to include lv_conf.h like `include "lv_conf.h"` instead of using its relative path.
- Click focus: you can enable focusing on an object in a group when it is clicked by a pointer an input device (mouse or touchpad)
- Add LV_GROUP_KEY_DEL
- Log system added to print useful debug info
- Uniscii monospace font is added as built-in font
- Edit/Navigate mode can be enabled for objects in a group. Useful for encoder based navigation.
- Adding a new character encoding interface (other than the built-in UTF-8) made easy
- LV_INDEV_TYPE_ENCODER: Encoder input device type (Left/Right/Push)
- Opportunity to use your existing tick handler instead of `lv_tick_inc`. See `lv_conf_templ.h`
- Themes can be changed in runtime (set `LV_THEME_LIVE_UPDATE` in lv_conf.h)
- A new theme called: Nemo
